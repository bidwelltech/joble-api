# Rationale

> Why did we make the choices we did while building this application?

## Loopback

Loopback was chosen to:

1. reduce the size of our codebase by leveraging the "magic" that loopback provides in its approach to RESTful API development
1. facilitate rapid API development so development time can be focused on the React client

## Postgresql

The data involved in this application is highly relational, thus a SQL database. Postgresql was chosen as it's the most popular SQL Database that I haven't worked with previously.
